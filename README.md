# Search-Algorithms
The project is hosted on github pages on this [link](https://zeenus.github.io/Search-Algorithms/)\
and it demonstrates 3 different kinds of search algorithms on a random grid based maze.\
\
Breadth first search, depth first search and A* (Astar) search algorithms are used \
to produce different results, with A* producing the most efficient search times.\
\
The visual aspect of the project is made possible with the use of p5.js which is a graphics library.
