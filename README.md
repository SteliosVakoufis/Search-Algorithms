# Search-Algorithms

This project demonstrates 3 different kinds of search algorithms on a random grid based maze.
\
Breadth first search, depth first search and A* (Astar) search algorithms are used 
to produce different results, with A* producing the most efficient search times.
\
The visual aspect of the project is made possible with the use of p5.js which is a graphics library.
